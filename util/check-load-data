# This program is intended to be run after loading Sakila into our test
# database, when starting the "sandbox" MySQL instances. It will store the
# checksums of all of the mysql and sakila tables into a magical
# percona_test.checksums table on instance 12345. Afterwards, one can verify the
# integrity of all of these tables by running
# lib/Sandbox.pm::verify_test_data_integrity() which will checksum the master
# and all of the slaves, and make sure all are OK.
