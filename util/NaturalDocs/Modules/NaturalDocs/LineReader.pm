#
#   An object to handle reading text files line by line in a cross platform manner.  Using this class instead of the standard
#	angle brackets approach has the following benefits:
#
#	- It strips all three types of line breaks automatically: CR/LF (Windows) LF (Unix) and CR (Classic Mac).  You do not need to
#	  call chomp().  Perl's chomp() fails when parsing Windows-format line breaks on a Unix platform anyway.  It leaves the /r on,
#	  which screws everything up.
#	- It reads Classic Mac files line by line correctly, whereas the Perl version returns it all as one line.
#	- It abstracts away ignoring the Unicode BOM on the first line, if present.
