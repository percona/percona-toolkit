=head1 NAME

mk-query-advisor - Scrutinize queries.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This POD sample simulates special POD stuff used by mk-query-advisor.  The
format used here is not the same actually used in mk-query-advisor.  This POD
sample is, therore, just for testing.

=head1 CHECKS

These are the check that mk-advisor can perform on a query.  There are several
classes of checks, each described in its own seciton.  You can add new checks
by adding new entires like the ones below.  Read L<"CHECK SYNTAX"> to learn
the structure of these checks.

=head2 Literals

id:    LIT.001
level: note
rule:  colval matches \d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.
desc:  IP address used as string.  The string literal looks like an IP address
       but is not used inside INET_ATON().  WHERE ip='127.0.0.1' is better as
       ip=INET_ATON('127.0.0.1') if the column is numeric.

id:    LIT.002
level: warn
rule:  colval matches (?:\d{2,4}-\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}|\d{4,6})
desc:  Date literal is not quoted.  WHERE col<2010-02-12 is valid but wrong;
       the date should be quoted.

=head2 Table List

id:    TBL.001
level: note
rule:  tbl matches *
desc:  SELECT *.  Selecting specific columns is preferable to SELECT *.

=head2 Clauses

id:    CLA.001
level: note
rule:  query matches ORDER BY RAND
desc:  ORDER BY RAND().  ORDER BY RAND() is not preferred.

=head2 Query

id:    QRY.001
level: note
rule:  INSERT without columns
desc:  Blind INSERT.  The INSERT does not specify columns.  INSERT INTO tbl
       (col1,col2) VALUES (1,2) is preferred to INSERT INTO tbl VALUES (1,2).

id:    QRY.002
level: note
rule:  query matches SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS
desc:  SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS does not scale.  SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS can cause
       performance problems because it does not scale well.

=head1 CHECK SYNTAX

Each check is a single paragraph (blank line before and after) with the
following attributes:

  * id     A unique ID used by the tool to identify the check
  * level  note, warn, or crit
  * rule   A special syntax telling the tool how to perform the check
  * desc   A terse, fuller and complete description of the check.

The check is two parts: CCC.NNN where CCC is the class abbreviation and NNN
is the next avaiable number.  The classes are shown above, LIT for Literals,
TBL for Table List, etc.  The numbers should never overlap or change.

The level is either note, warn or crit (for "critical").

The rule is a special, limited syntax that the tool translateis into code.
Each rule is a single sentence with a subject, verb and noun. These are:

  SUBJECT    REFERS TO
  =======    ================================================================
  query      The whole text of the query (the SQL statement)
  colval     Any column value for any column
  tbl        Any table from anywhere
  <DMS>      Any Data Manipulation Statement in caps: SELECT, INSERT, DELETE,
             etc.  The rule only applies if the query is this type of
             statement.
  clause     One of these MAGIC_clauses:
  
               GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT

  VERB       DOES
  =======    ================================================================
  matches    Perl regex match SUBJECT =~ m/NOUN/ims
  with       <DMS> subject has NOUN part
  without    <DMS> subject does not have NOUN part

  NOUN       DESCRIBES
  =======    ================================================================
  where      WHERE clause, used only with <DMS> subjects
  columns    Columns list of the query, used only with <DMS> subjects
  <...>      Anything after the verb, used with most verbs.

The description (desc) should have at least two period-terminate sentences.
The first sentece should be the terse definition of the check.  The second
sentence should be the fuller defintion.  Any more sentences are the complete
defintion of the check.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --define

type: array

Define these check IDs.  If L<"--verbose"> is zero (i.e. not specified) then
a terse definition is given.  If one then a fuller definition is given.  If
two then the complete definition is given.

=item --ignore-checks

type: array

Ignore these L<"CHECKS">.

=item --verbose

cumulative; default: 0

Print more information.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The environment variable C<MKDEBUG> enables verbose debugging output in all of the
Maatkit tools:

   MKDEBUG=1 mk-....
