# WARN delay_key_write: MyISAM index blocks are never flushed until necessary.

# WARN innodb_log_file_size: The InnoDB log file size is set to its default value, which is not usable on production systems.

# NOTE log_warnings-2: Log_warnings must be set greater than 1 to log unusual events such as aborted connections.

# NOTE max_connect_errors: max_connect_errors should probably be set as large as your platform allows.

# NOTE port: The server is listening on a non-default port.

# WARN slave_net_timeout: This variable is set too high.

# NOTE innodb_data_file_path: Auto-extending InnoDB files can consume a lot of disk space that is very difficult to reclaim later.

# NOTE innodb_flush_method: Most production database servers that use InnoDB should set innodb_flush_method to O_DIRECT to avoid double-buffering, unless the I/O system is very low performance.
