# WARN delay_key_write: MyISAM index blocks are never flushed until necessary. If there is a server crash, data corruption on MyISAM tables can be much worse than usual.

# WARN innodb_log_file_size: The InnoDB log file size is set to its default value, which is not usable on production systems. 

# NOTE log_warnings-2: Log_warnings must be set greater than 1 to log unusual events such as aborted connections. 

# NOTE max_connect_errors: max_connect_errors should probably be set as large as your platform allows. 

# NOTE port: The server is listening on a non-default port. 

# WARN slave_net_timeout: This variable is set too high. This is too long to wait before noticing that the connection to the master has failed and retrying.

# NOTE innodb_data_file_path: Auto-extending InnoDB files can consume a lot of disk space that is very difficult to reclaim later. Some people prefer to set innodb_file_per_table and allocate a fixed-size file for ibdata1.

# NOTE innodb_flush_method: Most production database servers that use InnoDB should set innodb_flush_method to O_DIRECT to avoid double-buffering, unless the I/O system is very low performance. 

# WARN myisam_recover_options: myisam_recover_options should be set to some value such as BACKUP,FORCE to ensure that table corruption is noticed. 

# WARN sync_binlog: Binary logging is enabled, but sync_binlog isn't configured so that every transaction is flushed to the binary log for durability.
