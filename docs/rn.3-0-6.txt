Percona Toolkit 3.0.6 includes the following changes:

New Features

* :jirabug:`PT-221`: Improve ``pt-table-sync`` support for ``MyRocks``
* :jirabug:`PT-218`: ``pt-stalk`` now checks the ``RocksDB`` status
* :jirabug:`PT-214`: ``pt-mysql-summary`` contains the ``RocksDB`` section
* :jirabug:`PT-205`: ``pt-osc`` shows a message if trying to set the engine to
  ``rocksdb`` and ``binlog_format != row``.
* :jirabug:`PT-204`: ``pt-table-checksum`` skips ``RocksDB`` tables.

Known Issues

* :jirabug:`PT-238`: The information message implemented for :jirabug:`PT-204` has a typo when referring to the ``--ignore-engines`` parameter. This problem is planned to be fixed in the next release.
* :jirabug:`PT-240`: It has been detected that the implementation of :jirabug:`PT-205` is not complete and ``pt-osc`` may fail when altering tables. This problem is planned to be fixed in the next release.

Bug Fixes     

* :jirabug:`PT-234`: The general log parser cannot handle timestamps which include time zones
* :jirabug:`PT-229`: ``pt-online-schema-change`` does not retry on a deadlock error when using ``Percona Server`` 5.7
