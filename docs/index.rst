 Percona Toolkit Documentation
===============================

Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by
Percona (`http://www.percona.com/ <http://www.percona.com/>`_) support staff to perform a variety of
MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because
they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented.
They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and
no libraries are installed.

Percona Toolkit is derived from Maatkit and Aspersa, two of the best-known
toolkits for MySQL server administration.  It is developed and supported by
Percona.  For more information and other free, open-source software
developed by Percona, visit `http://www.percona.com/software/ <http://www.percona.com/software/>`_.
