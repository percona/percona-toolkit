Notes:
1. Don't do this from the root of the bzr repo. fatpack tries to be clever
   and inlines everything under lib/
2. mkdir lib/ is to get around a bug(?) in fatpack
3. these two lines are safe to ignore:
File /tmp/pod2rst/fatlib/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/HTML/Parser/Parser.bs isn't a .pm file - can't pack this and if you hoped we were going to things may not be what you expected later
File /tmp/pod2rst/fatlib/darwin-thread-multi-2level/auto/HTML/Parser/Parser.bundle isn't a .pm file - can't pack this and if you hoped we were going to things may not be what you expected later
