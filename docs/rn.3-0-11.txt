v3.0.11 released 2018-07-06
===========================

New features

* :jirabug:`PT-1571`: Improved hostname recognition in ``pt-secure-collect``
* :jirabug:`PT-1569`: Disabled ``--alter-foreign-keys-method=drop_swap`` in ``pt-online-schema-change``
* :jirabug:`PT-242`: (``pt-stalk``) Include ``SHOW SLAVE STATUS`` on MySQL 5.7 (Thanks `Marcelo Altmann <https://www.percona.com/blog/author/marcelo-altmann/>`_)

Fixed bugs

* :jirabug:`PT-1570`: ``pt-archiver`` fails to detect columns with the word *GENERATED* as part of the comment
* :jirabug:`PT-1563`: ``pt-show-grants`` fails for MySQL 5.6 producing an error which reports that an unknown column **account_locked** has been detected.
* :jirabug:`PT-1551`: ``pt-table-checksum`` fails on MySQL 8.0.11
* :jirabug:`PT-241`: (``pt-stalk``) Slave queries don\'t run on MySQL 5.7 because the FQDN is missing (Thanks `Marcelo Altmann <https://www.percona.com/blog/author/marcelo-altmann/>`_)

Breaking changes:

Starting with this version, the queries checksum in ``pt-query-digest`` will
store the full MD5 field as a CHAR(32) field instead of storing just the least
significant bytes of the checksum as a BIGINT field.  The reason for this
change is that storing only the least significant bytes as a BIGINT was
producing inconsistent results in MySQL 8 compared to MySQL 5.6+.

``pt-online-schema-change`` in MySQL 8:

Due to a `bug in MySQL 8.0+ <https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=89441>`_, it
is not possible to use the ``drop_swap`` method to rebuild constraints because
renaming a table will result in losing the foreign keys. You must specify a
different method explicitly.
