Percona Toolkit
===============

Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by
Percona (http://www.percona.com/) support staff to perform a variety of
MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because
they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented.
They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and
no libraries are installed.

Percona Toolkit is developed and supported by Percona Inc.  For more
information and other free, open-source software developed by Percona,

Installing
----------

To install all tools, run:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

You probably need to be root to `make install'.  On most systems, the tools
are installed in /usr/local/bin.  See the INSTALL file for more information.

Documentation
-------------

Run `man percona-toolkit' to see a list of installed tools, then `man tool'
to read the embedded documentation for a specific tool.  You can also read
the documentation online at http://www.percona.com/software/percona-toolkit/.
