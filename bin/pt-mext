=head1 NAME

pt-mext - Look at many samples of MySQL C<SHOW GLOBAL STATUS> side-by-side.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage: pt-mext [OPTIONS] -- COMMAND

pt-mext columnizes repeated output from a program like mysqladmin extended.

Get output from C<mysqladmin>:

   pt-mext -r -- mysqladmin ext -i10 -c3"

Get output from a file:

   pt-mext -r -- cat mysqladmin-output.txt

=head1 RISKS

The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks,
whether known or unknown, of using this tool.  The two main categories of risks
are those created by the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write
tools) and those created by bugs.

pt-mext is a read-only tool.  It should be very low-risk.

At the time of this release, we know of no bugs that could cause serious harm
to users.

The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue
tracking system.  Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.  You can
see a list of such issues at the following URL:
L<http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-mext>.

See also L<"BUGS"> for more information on filing bugs and getting help.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

pt-mext executes the C<COMMAND> you specify, and reads through the result one
line at a time.  It places each line into a temporary file.  When it finds a
blank line, it assumes that a new sample of SHOW GLOBAL STATUS is starting,
and it creates a new temporary file.  At the end of this process, it has a
number of temporary files.  It joins the temporary files together side-by-side
and prints the result.  If the L<"-r"> option is given, it first subtracts
each sample from the one after it before printing results.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -r

Relative: subtract each column from the previous column.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

This tool does not use any environment variables.

=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This tool requires the Bourne shell (F</bin/sh>) and the seq program.

=head1 BUGS

For a list of known bugs, see L<http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-mext>.

Please report bugs at L<https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit>.
Include the following information in your bug report:

=over

=item * Complete command-line used to run the tool

=item * Tool L<"--version">

=item * MySQL version of all servers involved

=item * Output from the tool including STDERR

=item * Input files (log/dump/config files, etc.)

=back

If possible, include debugging output by running the tool with C<PTDEBUG>;
see L<"ENVIRONMENT">.
