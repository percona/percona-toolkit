=head1 NAME

rel - Make each number in a line of text relative to the previous matching line.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Given a file with some lines of text that follow a repeated pattern, including
numbers,

  rel /path/to/file.txt

For example, if the text is this:

  Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 99584819933, OS waits 437663963
  RW-shared spins 834337527, OS waits 20258150; RW-excl spins 1769749834
  Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 99591465498, OS waits 437698122
  RW-shared spins 834352175, OS waits 20259032; RW-excl spins 1769762980

The output will be

  Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 99584819933, OS waits 437663963
  RW-shared spins 834337527, OS waits 20258150; RW-excl spins 1769749834
  Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 6645565, OS waits 34159
  RW-shared spins 14648, OS waits 882; RW-excl spins 13146
