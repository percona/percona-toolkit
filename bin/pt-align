=head1 NAME

pt-align - Read lines and split them into words.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage: pt-align [OPTION...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program reads in lines and splits them into words.  It counts how many
words each line has, and if there is one number that predominates, it assumes
this is the number of words in each line.  Then it discards all lines that
don't have that many words, and looks at the 2nd line that DOES.  It assumes
this is the first non-header line.  Based on whether each word looks numeric
or not, it decides on column alignment.  Finally, it goes through and decides
how wide each column should be, and then prints them out.

This is useful for things like aligning the output of vmstat or iostat so it
is easier to read.
