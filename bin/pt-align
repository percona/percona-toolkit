=head1 NAME

pt-align - Align output from other tools to columns.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage: pt-align [FILES]

pt-align aligns output from other tools to columns.  If no FILES are specified,
STDIN is read.

If a tool prints the following output,

   DATABASE TABLE   ROWS
   foo      bar      100
   long_db_name table  1
   another  long_name 500

then pt-align reprints the output as,

   DATABASE     TABLE     ROWS
   foo          bar        100
   long_db_name table        1
   another      long_name  500

=head1 RISKS

The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks,
whether known or unknown, of using this tool.  The two main categories of risks
are those created by the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write
tools) and those created by bugs.

pt-align is a read-only tool.  It should be very low-risk.

At the time of this release, we know of no bugs that could cause serious harm
to users.

The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue
tracking system.  Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.  You can
see a list of such issues at the following URL:
L<http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-align>.

See also L<"BUGS"> for more information on filing bugs and getting help.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

pt-align reads lines and splits them into words.  It counts how many
words each line has, and if there is one number that predominates, it assumes
this is the number of words in each line.  Then it discards all lines that
don't have that many words, and looks at the 2nd line that does.  It assumes
this is the first non-header line.  Based on whether each word looks numeric
or not, it decides on column alignment.  Finally, it goes through and decides
how wide each column should be, and then prints them out.

This is useful for things like aligning the output of vmstat or iostat so it
is easier to read.

=head1 OPTIONS

This tool does not have any command-line options.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

This tool does not use any environment variables.

=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

You need Perl, and some core packages that ought to be installed in any
reasonably new version of Perl.
