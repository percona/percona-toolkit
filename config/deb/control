Description: Advanced MySQL and system command-line tools
 Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by
 Percona (http://www.percona.com/) support staff to perform a variety of
 MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.
 .
 These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because
 they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented.
 They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and
 no libraries are installed. 
 .
 Percona Toolkit is developed and supported by Percona.  For more
 information and other free, open-source software developed by Percona,
