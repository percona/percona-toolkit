# Sub: parse_event
#   Parse rows from PROCESSLIST to make events when queries finish.
#
# Parameters:
#   %args - Arguments
#
# Required Arguments:
#   code - Callback that returns an arrayref of rows from SHOW PROCESSLIST.
#          Replication threads and $dbh->{mysql_thread_id} should be removed
#          from the return value.
#
# Returns:
#   Hashref of a completed event.
#
# Technical Details:
#   Connections (cxn) are tracked in a hashref ($self->{active_cxn}) by their
#   Id from the proclist.  Each poll of the proclist (i.e. each call to the
#   code callback) causes the current cxn/queries to be compared to the saved
#   (active) cxn. One of three things can happen: a new cxn appears, a query
#   ends/changes/restarts, or a cxn ends (and thus ends its query).
#
#   When a new connect appears, we only begin tracking it when the Info column
#   from the proclist is not null, indicating that the cxn is executing a
#   query.  The full proclist for this cxn is saved for comparison with later
#   polls.  This is $prev in the code which really references
#   $self->{active_cxn}.
#
#   For existing cxn, if the Info is the same (i.e. same query), and the Time
#   hasn't decreased, and the query hasn't restarted (look below in the code
#   for how we detect this), then the cxn is still executing the same query.
#   So we do nothing.  But if any one of those 3 conditions is false, that
#   signals a new query.  So we make an event based on saved info from the
#   last poll, then updated the cxn for the new query already in progress.
#
#   When a previously active cxn no longer appears in a poll, then that cxn
#   has ended and so did it's query, so we make an event for the query and
#   then delete the cxn from $self->{active_cxn}.  This is checked in the
#   PREVIOUSLY_ACTIVE_CXN loop.
#
#   The default MySQL server has one-second granularity in the Time column.
#   This means that a statement that starts at X.9 seconds shows 0 seconds
#   for only 0.1 second.  A statement that starts at X.0 seconds shows 0 secs
#   for a second, and 1 second up until it has actually been running 2 seconds.
#   This makes it tricky to determine when a statement has been restarted.
#   Further, this program and MySQL may have some clock skew.  Even if they
#   are running on the same machine, it's possible that at X.999999 seconds
#   we get the time, and at X+1.000001 seconds we get the snapshot from MySQL.
#   (Fortunately MySQL doesn't re-evaluate now() for every process, or that
#   would cause even more problems.)  And a query that's issued to MySQL may
#   stall for any amount of time before it's executed, making even more skew
#   between the times.
#
#   One worst case is,
#     * The processlist measures time at 100.01 and it's 100.
#     * We measure the time.  It says 100.02.
#     * A query was started at 90.  Processlist says Time=10.
#     * We calculate that the query was started at 90.02.
#     * Processlist measures it at 100.998 and it's 100.
#     * We measure time again, it says 100.999.
#     * Time has passed, but the Time column still says 10.
#
#   Another is,
#     * We get the processlist, then the time.
#     * A second later we get the processlist, but it takes 2 sec to fetch.
#     * We measure the time and it looks like 3 sec have passed, but proclist
#       says only one has passed.  This is why etime is necessary.
#   What should we do?  Well, the key thing to notice here is that a new
#   statement has started if a) the Time column actually decreases since we
#   last saw the process, or b) the Time column does not increase for 2
#   seconds, plus the etime of the first and second measurements combined!

# Possible find_spec are:

#   * busy_time      Match queries that have been Command=Query for longer than
#                    this time
#   * idle_time      Match queries that have been Command=Sleep for longer than
#                    this time
#   * ignore         A hashref of properties => regex patterns to ignore
#   * match          A hashref of properties => regex patterns to match
