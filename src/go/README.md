#Percona Toolkit
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/percona/toolkit-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/percona/toolkit-go)  

Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by Percona support staff to perform a variety of MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented. They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and no libraries are installed.

Percona Toolkit is developed and supported by Percona Inc. For more information and other free, open-source software developed by Percona, visit http://www.percona.com/software/.

This is the repository for new tools, written in Go. Please visit the [main repository](https://github.com/percona/percona-toolkit) for more information.
